I completed the vehicle inspection portion of this project. This code detects vehicles in a car park and where they are going, thus marking if a space or road is occupied to better plan emergency evacuation routes. The code detects vehicles from still images and videos. It uses the Yolo model in Matlab for vehicle detection, which is a large model trained on the coco dataset for vehicle detection and is suitable for the functionality that the project is trying to achieve. 

The problem of this part is that some vehicles may not be detected due to lighting, shape, colour, etc., and there are occasional cases where scene obstacles are mistaken for vehicles. This may because of the fact that the dataset on which the model is trained is not sufficient and does not cover specific types of vehicles, lighting and angles. To make improvements, other more powerful datasets can be used, such as the Python-based OpenCV+Yolo8, or autonomous training datasets. If there is an opportunity to improve the project in the future, I will focus on this aspect.
